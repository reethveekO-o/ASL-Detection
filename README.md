# American Sign Language (ASL) Detector

This project uses a pretrained **TensorFlow** model (downloaded from [KaggleHub](https://www.kaggle.com/)) to recognize **American Sign Language (ASL)** hand signs in real time through a webcam feed.  

The application captures a region of interest (ROI) where the user places their hand, preprocesses the image, and runs inference to predict the corresponding ASL sign.
